This is my version of a Python script that calculates the wages of an employee in a company based on the hours they've worked.

The program asks the employee for an hourly pay rate and hours worked per week. 

The program calculates gross pay (hours * rate), withholding tax, and net pay (gross pay - withholding tax). 

The hours worked should not be more than 40 hours per week and not be less than zero (0). 

The minimum hourly rate is $12.50 per hour and maximum is $150.00 per hour. 

Withholding tax is calculates as a percentage of gross pay based on the following:

            Gross Pay ($)                   Withholding Tax
            300.00 and less                        10%
            300.01 to 400.00                       12%
            400.01 to 500.00                       15%
            500.01 and over                        20%
