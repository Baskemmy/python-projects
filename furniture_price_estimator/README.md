This is my version of a Python script for a furniture company; 

According to the problem, the company needs a program that can determine the price of a table depending on the wood material the user picks. 

The user is to be given options to choose 1 for pine, 2 for oak, or 3 for mahogany. 

The output will give the name of the wood chosen as well as the price of the table. 

Here, pine tables cost $100, oak tables cost $225, and mahogany tables cost $310. 

If the user enters an invalid wood name (any wood name not on the options), the price will be set to 0. 

If the user enters a choice other 1, 2, or 3 then an “invalid choice” message will be displayed.
