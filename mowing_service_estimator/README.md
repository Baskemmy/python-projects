This my version of a Python script for a lawn-mowing service.

According to the problem, the lawn-mowing season lasts 20 weeks and the weekly fee for mowing a lot under 4,000 square feet is $25. 

The fee for a lot that is 4,000 square feet or more, but under 6000 square feet, is $35 per week. 

The fee for a lot that is 6,000 square feet or over is $50 per week. 

We want the user to be able to enter the length and width on their lawn and get the weekly mowing fee in addition to the 20-week seasonal fee.
